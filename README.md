# Course 1 (NLP with Classification and Vector Spaces)
## Week 1 (Sentiment Analysis with Logistic Regression)
Learn to extract features from text into numerical vectors, then build a binary classifier for tweets using a logistic regression!
### Objectives
- Sentiment analysis
- Logistic regression
- Data pre-processing
- Calculating word frequencies
- Feature extraction
- Vocabulary creation
- Supervised learning
## Week 2 (Sentiment Analysis with Naive Bayes)
Learn the theory behind Bayes' rule for conditional probabilities, then apply it toward building a Naive Bayes tweet classifier of your own!
### Objectives
- Error analysis
- Naive Bayes inference
- Log likelihood
- Laplacian smoothing
- conditional probabilities
- Bayes rule
- Sentiment analysis
- Vocabulary creation
- Supervised learning
## Week 3 (Vector space models)
Vector space models capture semantic meaning and relationships between words. You'll learn how to create word vectors that capture dependencies between words, then visualize their relationships in two dimensions using PCA.
### Objectives

- Dimensionality reduction
- Principal component analysis
- Cosine similarity
- Euclidean distance
- Co-occurrence matrices
- Vector representations
- Vector space models
## Week 4 (Machine translation and Document search)
Learn to transform word vectors and assign them to subsets using locality sensitive hashing, in order to perform machine translation and document search.
### Objectives
- Gradient descent
- Approximate nearest neighbors
- Locality sensitive hashing
- Hash functions
- Hash tables
- K nearest neighbors
- Document search
- Machine translation
- Frobenius norm

- Dynamic programming
- Minimum edit distance
- Autocorrect
## Week 2 (Part-of-speech tagging and Hidden Markov models)
Learn about Markov chains and Hidden Markov models, then use them to create part-of-speech tags for a Wall Street Journal text corpus!
### Objectives
